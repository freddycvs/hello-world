Lets learn to code!


I've always been fascinated with anything remotely technological. I'm currently 14 years of age and my dream is to start a tech company in Silicon Valley. I want to create something that will have an impact on an unimaginable amount of people. My dream job has always been to be a software engineer (programmer). With freecodecamp I'm hoping to get a step closer to all of my dreams.
